Code Structure
The application is built with a single main function that:
Initializes an empty task list
Displays a menu of options
Processes user input
Handles all task operations (add, view, delete)
Includes error handling for invalid inputs

Notes
Tasks are stored in memory and will be lost when the program exits
The application validates all user inputs to prevent errors
Task numbers start at 1 (not 0) for user-friendly operation

Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for this application could include:
Saving tasks to a file for persistence between sessions
Adding due dates and priorities to tasks
Implementing task categories or tags
Adding editing functionality for existing tasks
Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) version
